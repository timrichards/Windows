"The main purpose of Double File is to allow you to pack up your drive and go: transition from one computer to another;
or put a new drive or operating system in. Copy the files you use then let the rest just sit in storage. Drive capacities
and speeds are increasing. This drive has nothing better to do than serve as backup; to maintain enviroment state. Plug it
back in and be right where you were when you left it. But wait - what's actually on those drives, and are they backed up?
Out of sight, out of mind: that's where Double File comes in. Catalog them, then have them curated for you on your current
setup as they sit in storage: safe from transitional hazards. Plan well, then act: reuse the drives after making a plan.
