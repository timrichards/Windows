- WithWinProgress(() => {});
- stop the auto horizontal scrolling - solve it by selecting first column
- not fixed: First tree view item is bold and the wrong forecolors, incl highlighted - treeview shouldn't have a selected item.
- tree map still doesn't always show up at all (on top of slow calc etc as before) on 6/24/15
- large file tree map blacks out switching between items 1 and 2 - item 1 has bitmap size of 1152: loaded too slow for it.
- wpf treemap
- Why are some folders white? Why do some folders not say they're duplicated?
- Todo: save volume group.\nTodo: save include y/n
- dupe vm event alerts: static vm internal counter or static transmit
- fix slider in tree list

- Overwrite? probe prompt is main window width yet it centers over New/Edit dialog. Make it width of window it's centered on.
- Click OK on that and in another instance and Double File disappears behind another app.
- string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace
- Unimplemented code in DriveSerialStatic.cs which tries to scan all drives to find model # - not an issue: serial # usb is
- Serial #? Lose USB class: drive speed matters less than the politically incorrect suggestion to turn of antivirus
- Allow a notes field
- Mark user-entered model/serial number
- Allow rescan of drive, with history difference, or allow copying values of already saved to the new one
- Allow opening values of listing file that failed scanning
- Add folder name to suffix title Tree List: My Documents; Files in Folder: My Documents; Folders Here: My Documents; etc.
- Tree list is not updating from treemap selection - or maybe it's a drill down - didn't respond to tree map drill up. Did.
- Option to show drive label and model/serial in Volume text (Nickname)
- Good that tree does not autoupdate: extra window. Allow filter by volume type; for example.
- allow two different file windows to point to two different folders: each new folder window should have its own children
- compare mode - how is this folder different from that one besides looking at the details: show missing/different file.
- Filtering user control header for tree list; tree view; files; search; duplicates
- open project; nav save listings; cancel; nav nav; complete save listings; nav explorer create; cancel: should project page.
- show messagbox title
- This folder has no exact copy: so please itemize in a report what the exact differences are to the nearest copy.
	- K nearest neighbor; PCA; etc.: score the folders with a function resulting in a double.
	- linear regression: split hash into X an Y - multiply by # of files for magnitude
	- Allow a list of important files and directories to watch, with alerts; links; etc.:
		- Invert the exclusive principle. Start inclusive, not with an ignore list.
	- Folders and files that are missing; or that are different.
	- Invert the size matters principle: some of the most important files may go unnoticed: just a drop in the bucket.
	- Restore the ignore list: nobody cares about the Windows or Program Files directories. Don't make moron reports.
- A 64 bit hash has 1 chance in 18 quintillion. Do collision tests: e.g. run SHA1 against MD5. Put statistics under Advanced.
- last modified time as part of comparison; or notification: hash equal but mod times are different
- wolfram-alpha front-end; curate; data -> query language: what state are my backups in? What are the best queries to bring forward?
- compare the 4K vs 128K correlations to see what they caught.
- USBDevice.SerialNumber - may just be a downstream hub

- check properties that are only supposed to be set once to true: make them Set methods
- Allow method chaining: return this instead of void
- hash version is not shown to the user.
- should the 2-pass listing save go out to the fs twice or just cache all the filenames?
- Remove WidthListingFile and redo the ListingFile setter to internal - same goes for progress dialog though
- replace properties with converters
- replace DarkWindow with flyouts
- allow moving the window when darkened
- minimize progress/messagebox to task bar?
- New Listing File dialog flashes when system choose folder dialog is shown

- regex search
- vertical scrollbar: window height clips volumes lv
- rollover highlight project image button text
- set hover bg same as bg in project lv for group etc
- scroll to highlighted item in LVs
- clones lvs; and all dupe files lv?
- Sync To button in tree view
- allow user toggle showing free space
- UX tree map free space
- go to button in tree map
- tool tip to tree map title bar area
- resource all stringets; en-us etc.
- auto layout? save layout?
- Apply async/await
- Who collaborates/reviews? Who wants to learn from this code base?
- Research runtime asserts vs unit testing online. Throw exceptions instead, perhaps.
	NUnit: replace MboxStatic assert with [TestMethod] and Assert.AreEqual, etc.
- services, decouple: Unity frameork: rewrite in Node/Angular; C++; Linux etc. Start these with unit testing.
- what C# features don't translate well to other languages like C++? is operator?
- all threads are background as of 6/12/15
- neither is nor as are reflection. as is 20x slower though. p. 123
